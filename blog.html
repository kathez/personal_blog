                    <li>One idea came to my mind is a tracker for all items that I tend to lose or easily to forget where I put it.
                        It should have a app or website to find the item by playing sounds or flash light, and a physical tracker as a
                        sticker to put on the item. The sticker tracker can play sound and flash light as user controls it. It should
                        also have a map to indicate the location of the item.</li>

                    <li>
                        Identify 4 things/experiences that you think were thoughtfully designed. For each, provide an image
                        and short description (including link to website and/or video, if appropriate).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For each, provide 3-5 highly specific reasons why you think the design is successful. As you do
                        this, think about all of the factors that go into designing that we have talked about in class.

                        <ul>
                            <li>It is easy to understand what layer it currently is and the relationship between other layers</li>
                            <li>To move the layer, simply drag it to a desired position and drop. It is a natural behavior to pick up</li>
                            <li>It is very intuitive and self-explanatory in its functionality and ways to use it.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Unlike other clothes iron, it uses material instead of temperature to indicate different
                                settings for different materials. It is easy to understand for users without much
                                experience with temperature for each material</li>
                            <li>It uses image to show the amount of steams with different materials. It is easy to understand. </li>
                            <li>It uses image to represent different types of steam instead of words. It works very well for
                                users to understand the functionality visually.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Like the previous item, it uses image icons to indicate different settings, such as defrost,
                                toast bagel, and cancel.</li>
                            <li>It has the simple and appealing design that also adds on a good user experience. </li>
                            <li>It has a handle to push up the toast if it is too small and hard to get it out.</li>

                    <li><img src="img/exp4.jpg" alt="camera"/></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is also a good experience made by the image icon. With different icons, it shows the
                            different settings very clearly. </li>
                            <li>With auto setting, it has two for users to choose, with flash and without flash. This is a
                            very useful setting that I use a lot. I don't need to learn any techniques, as long as I have
                            these two settings.</li>
                            <li>Instead of icon, it uses word to explain the button functionality. In this situation, icon
                            won't make much sense, and the words make my user experience better and easier.</li>

                    This n+1 design adds the function of zoom in and focus on small area of an item. It helps to identify
                    the color within a pattern or a mixed colored clothes. The original design can only identify a solid
                    color, but in real life many items are mixed color or have patterns.
                    This app provides zoom in scale to change the focus area in order to adjust for different size of the
                    pattern. It also provides a magnified view for user to move around the focus area based on his/her
                    need.

                <h2>PROCESS BOOK 6</h2>
                <p>
                    For this week’s Process Book entry, go online and find examples of participatory design experiences.
                    Plan a participatory experience to share with your users that will enable them to become part of
                    your design process and at the same time enable you to learn more about what the world looks like
                    from their perspective. Document your plan using text and images.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My research shows that people use Participatory design to "encourage the active involvement of
                    potential or current end-users of a system in the design and decision-making processes". It covers
                    a wide range of perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of concern. My plan for participatory experience
                    is to invite prospective users to show us how they do certain tasks, such as checking whether food
                    is cooked, seeing the traffic light signal, and choosing outfit for different dress code from casual
                    to business professional. By observing their activity, we can ask them to describe any difficulty they
                    encounter as the process goes. We can document the area of difficulties and make a priority lists to
                    design our app's functionality in assisting people with colorblindness.

                <h2>PROCESS BOOK 5</h2>
                <p>
                    For this entry, highlight 3-5 design decisions that your team has made up until this point.
                    For each, summarize the choice, explain how you arrived at a decision, and describe the final outcome.

                    In addition to the verbal explanation, provide a photo or drawing
                    that represents the problem, a photo or drawing that represents the choice to be made, and a photo or
                    drawing that represents the final decision your team made.

                    Here is our initial ideas list.Then we come down to these areas around the problem space "what color

                        they have.

                <h3>Color Identifier App</h3>
                <p>
                    We come up with the app to help people who are colorblind to identify the color to correct their difference in color
                    perception. At the same time, it will help them to find the matched color pairs their outfit. I noticed that my boyfriend
                    usually ask me which tie matches the shirt he picked. He is very minor colorblind, and it is still a hard task for him
                    every morning. Therefore we want to not only identify the color but also providing a matched color/matched colors for them
                    to pick their outfit.
                </p>

                <h3>Traffic Light Detector</h3>
                <p>
                    Depends on the type of colorblindnesses, people who have different color perception than normal vision has will hard time to
                    tell the difference in traffic light. Even though they can see the position of the light that is on to tell which color it is (Red,
                    Yellow, Green), it is very hard to do so at night with low light. Therefore we came up with the idea in developing an app to detect
                    the traffic light color when they drive.
                </p>

                <h3>Food cooked or not</h3>
                <p>
                    In the colorblindness problem space, people who are colorblind can't see the slight difference between colorsm fr example the light pink
                    and white. It gives them a hard time to tell whether the meat is cooked or not. Expanding from the the color identifier app, we
                    came up with the idea to check the color difference between the color in the middle of the meat and the color on the outside to tell
                    whether food is cooked or not.

                    Watch the two videos below. Reflect on the range of physical, emotional and social aspects of blindness
                    you observe. Include at least 2 images and 3 paragraphs of text with your reflection.
                </p>

                </ul>

                <p>There are three pictures come to my mind after I watch the video. I wasn't aware of the people who have vision impairment. Before I
                don't like the beeping sound of traffic light, but now I have realized how helpful and essential these sound
                will help people who have trouble to see the traffic light. </p>
                <p>
                    One thing is directly related to blind people: <img src="img/blind_1.jpg" alt="blind reader"/> I have seen a blind man
                    read his email by touching these changing blind reader line by line. It was not the fixed ones but changing with the things
                    he typed. It is also combined with the screen reader. He told me when he was typing an email, "I want to make sure I typed 'p',"
                    while he was touching the reader. I thought it will be hard for people to "see" the spell of a word, if they are blind. He proved
                    that I was wrong. It inspires me to think out of box in term of coming up with the design to help people with visual impairment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_1.jpg" alt="color blind vision of colorful ties"/>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_2.jpg" alt="color blind vision of woman in red dress"/>
                    Another thing that comes to my mind is the world the color blind people see. To me, it is not a easy to pick the right color
                    that I feel it represents me, either bright or light. However, how can people who can't see the color we see pick the color for their
                    outfit. People might have different preference, but the rules of color are the same, either complementary color or similar color. If there is
                    a way to help people identify color, it will help people having trouble with color to know what the colors they pick meant to people with
                    normal vision.
