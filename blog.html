                    Watch the two videos below. Reflect on the range of physical, emotional and social aspects of blindness
                    you observe. Include at least 2 images and 3 paragraphs of text with your reflection.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndVOLGHmpWo">Myths about blindness</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p>There are three pictures come to my mind after I watch the video. I wasn't aware of the people who have vision impairment. Before I
                don't like the beeping sound of traffic light, but now I have realized how helpful and essential these sound
                will help people who have trouble to see the traffic light. </p>
                <p>
                    One thing is directly related to blind people: <img src="img/blind_1.jpg" alt="blind reader"/> I have seen a blind man
                    read his email by touching these changing blind reader line by line. It was not the fixed ones but changing with the things
                    he typed. It is also combined with the screen reader. He told me when he was typing an email, "I want to make sure I typed 'p',"
                    while he was touching the reader. I thought it will be hard for people to "see" the spell of a word, if they are blind. He proved
                    that I was wrong. It inspires me to think out of box in term of coming up with the design to help people with visual impairment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_1.jpg" alt="color blind vision of colorful ties"/>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_2.jpg" alt="color blind vision of woman in red dress"/>
                    Another thing that comes to my mind is the world the color blind people see. To me, it is not a easy to pick the right color
                    that I feel it represents me, either bright or light. However, how can people who can't see the color we see pick the color for their
                    outfit. People might have different preference, but the rules of color are the same, either complementary color or similar color. If there is
                    a way to help people identify color, it will help people having trouble with color to know what the colors they pick meant to people with
                    normal vision.
