                <h1>Design Decisions</h1>
                <h2>PROCESS BOOK 5</h2>
                <p>
                    For this entry, highlight 3-5 design decisions that your team has made up until this point.
                    For each, summarize the choice, explain how you arrived at a decision, and describe the final outcome.

                    In addition to the verbal explanation, provide a photo or drawing
                    that represents the problem, a photo or drawing that represents the choice to be made, and a photo or
                    drawing that represents the final decision your team made.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An app to indentify colors for people who are colorblind, at the same time coordinate colors
                        for people who are colorblind based on their preference and the clothes
                        they have.
                    </li>
                    <li>Traffic light detector for people who are colorblind.</li>
                    <li>A app to tell the meat is cooked or not based on the color of the meat.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Color Identifier App</h3>
                <p>
                    We come up with the app to help people who are colorblind to identify the color to correct their difference in color
                    perception. At the same time, it will help them to find the matched color pairs their outfit. I noticed that my boyfriend
                    usually ask me which tie matches the shirt he picked. He is very minor colorblind, and it is still a hard task for him
                    every morning. Therefore we want to not only identify the color but also providing a matched color/matched colors for them
                    to pick their outfit.
                </p>

                <h3>Traffic Light Detector</h3>
                <p>
                    Depends on the type of colorblindnesses, people who have different color perception than normal vision has will hard time to
                    tell the difference in traffic light. Even though they can see the position of the light that is on to tell which color it is (Red,
                    Yellow, Green), it is very hard to do so at night with low light. Therefore we came up with the idea in developing an app to detect
                    the traffic light color when they drive.
                </p>

                <h3>Food cooked or not</h3>
                <p>
                    In the colorblindness problem space, people who are colorblind can't see the slight difference between colorsm fr example the light pink
                    and white. It gives them a hard time to tell whether the meat is cooked or not. Expanding from the the color identifier app, we
                    came up with the idea to check the color difference between the color in the middle of the meat and the color on the outside to tell
                    whether food is cooked or not.

                <h2>PROCESS BOOK 2 - Experience as a spectrum</h2>
                <p>
                    Watch the two videos below. Reflect on the range of physical, emotional and social aspects of blindness
                    you observe. Include at least 2 images and 3 paragraphs of text with your reflection.
                </p>

                </ul>

                <p>There are three pictures come to my mind after I watch the video. I wasn't aware of the people who have vision impairment. Before I
                don't like the beeping sound of traffic light, but now I have realized how helpful and essential these sound
                will help people who have trouble to see the traffic light. </p>
                <p>
                    One thing is directly related to blind people: <img src="img/blind_1.jpg" alt="blind reader"/> I have seen a blind man
                    read his email by touching these changing blind reader line by line. It was not the fixed ones but changing with the things
                    he typed. It is also combined with the screen reader. He told me when he was typing an email, "I want to make sure I typed 'p',"
                    while he was touching the reader. I thought it will be hard for people to "see" the spell of a word, if they are blind. He proved
                    that I was wrong. It inspires me to think out of box in term of coming up with the design to help people with visual impairment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_1.jpg" alt="color blind vision of colorful ties"/>
                    <img src="img/color_blind_2.jpg" alt="color blind vision of woman in red dress"/>
                    Another thing that comes to my mind is the world the color blind people see. To me, it is not a easy to pick the right color
                    that I feel it represents me, either bright or light. However, how can people who can't see the color we see pick the color for their
                    outfit. People might have different preference, but the rules of color are the same, either complementary color or similar color. If there is
                    a way to help people identify color, it will help people having trouble with color to know what the colors they pick meant to people with
                    normal vision.
